\section{Diodes}
\subsection{To design ICs you need to know:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How is a MOS-transistor working?
    \item Which paramters influence the transistor?
    \item How are they influenced?
    \item How to design logic functions from transistors?
    \item Sequential circuits
    \item Design for test.
    \item Timing/clocking
    \item Tools
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Why CMOS}
\begin{itemize}
    \item CMOS uses MOSFETSs
    \item Boon for digital (power dissipation mostly during switching)
    \item Area benefits by scaling down the transistor sizes 
    \item Low cost
    \item Analog design also favors CMOS (performance of MOSFETs has become comparable to BJTs)
\end{itemize}
