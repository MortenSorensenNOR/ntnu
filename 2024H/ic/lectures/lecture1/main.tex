\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Curriculum, design project and guest lectures}
\subsubsection{Curriculum}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The textbooks are: \textbf{Analog Integrated Circuit Design by Carusone, Johns and Martin} and \textbf{Integrated Circuit Design by Weste and Harris} (however, the first 
        book only a few chapters are relevant)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The semester project}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Groups of 2 people. Find a partner as soon as possible, as you need to share accounts for the Project and possibly the exercises. (Exercises are handed in and approved 
        on an individual basis). If you haven't found a partner by time x, we'll find one
    \item A minimum of 4 out of 6 exercieses must be approved for entrance to the exam
    \item Remember deadlines. They are firm, in a way similar to the case for a written exam.
    \item Example of earlier project: Camera array
    \item Project from 2022: DRAM cell
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Guest lectures}


\subsection{Grading}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The report is 30\% of the final grade
    \item The final exam is 70\% of the grade
\end{itemize}
