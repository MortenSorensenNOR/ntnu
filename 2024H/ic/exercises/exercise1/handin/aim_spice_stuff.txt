c)
Using the DC Operating Point function gave me a leakage current 
of -9.857 pA

d) Because the area of the 50x50um diode is (50/100)^2 = 1/4 the area, the following code can be used to model the smaller diode 
"""
.include C:\Users\morte\Downloads\DBSBdiode.mod

Vdd v+ 0 DC 4.8V
D1 anode cathode DSUB 0.25
.connect cathode v+
.connect anode 0

.plot I(Vdd)
"""

This gives a leakage current of -6.06 pA at 4.8V. The relationship between size and leakage current is not quite linear. A quarter of 
diode size did not give a quarter of the leakage current.

e) The built-in junction voltage would be the "VJ" parameter, which is set to 0.89V

f) Yeah, it seems as if the current starts to increase siginificantly around 0.89V
