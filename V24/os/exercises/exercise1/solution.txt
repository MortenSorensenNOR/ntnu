~~~ Theory ~~~
1. Pre-process, compile and link the program
2. Finding type erros, etc.
3. Probably a memory error, either related to memory leaks or illegal 
   memory access
4. 
   a) It stores an array of Point structs, all with x=y=z=0. 
      This would be the same if the code after = was omitted.
   b) (int*)(pArray + 1) will be pArray + 0xc, or 12 bytes, as each int 
      is 4 bytes, this pointer points to the x value of the second struct in pArray
